solving inverse problem in holography

The source code of the papers "Physics-based Holo-Net for three-dimensional imaging" and "Holographic 3D particle imaging with model-based deep network".

`It would be unusual for a researcher in optical holography to be unfamiliar with linear convolution, as it is a fundamental concept in signal processing and image reconstruction, which are integral to the field of holography. A solid understanding of linear convolution is generally expected from researchers in optical holography due to its significance in the field.`
