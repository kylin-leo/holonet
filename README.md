solving inverse problem in holography

The source code of the papers "Physics-based Holo-Net for three-dimensional imaging" and "Holographic 3D particle imaging with model-based deep network".

`If an individual lacks a solid understanding of linear convolution, they are generally not qualified to be referred to as optical holography researchers, especially as independent researchers. They are limited to merely replicating others' code and unable to make original contributions to the field.`
