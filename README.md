solving inverse problem in holography

The source code of the papers "Physics-based Holo-Net for three-dimensional imaging" and "Holographic 3D particle imaging with model-based deep network".

`Some experiences gained through this work: Based on the importance of linear convolution in the field of holography, it is widely expected that optical holography researchers possess a solid understanding of this fundamental concept. Conversely, if an individual lacks a solid understanding of linear convolution, they are not typically expected to be optical holography researchers.`
